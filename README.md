## Dependencies

You need to have [`cmocka`](https://cmocka.org) installed to run unit tests. Since it is packaged with most distributions, you should be able to retrieve it by running 

```
sudo apt install cmocka
```

To use `cmocka` take a look at [their documentation](https://api.cmocka.org/group__cmocka__asserts.html).
